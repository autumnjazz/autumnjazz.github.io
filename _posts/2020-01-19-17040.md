Each of his M cows has two favorite pastures, and he wants to be sure different types of grass are planted in each N pastures.

### My 1st Correct Code


```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	int N, M;
	int pasture[101][101];
	int seed[101];
	std::cin >> N >> M;
	for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
		int t1, t2;
		std::cin >> t1 >> t2;
		pasture[t1][t2] = 1;
		pasture[t2][t1] = 1;
	}

	seed[1] = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
		int tmp[5] = { 0, };
		for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
			if (pasture[i][j] != 1) continue;
			tmp[seed[j]] = 1;
		}
		for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) {
			if (tmp[k] == 0) {
				seed[i] = k;
				break;
			}
		}
	}

	for (int k = 1; k <= N; k++) {
		printf("%d", seed[k]);
	}

}
```
